Welcome to the Editor's guide to the Handbook! This page contains resources around how the editors work.

## What does an editor do?

Editors are those tying together all the strings in this community handbook. We keep a bird's eye view to ensure that what you read makes sense. Each editor commits themselves to providing timely reviews of topics, guides, or both.[^1]

[^1]: Each editor chooses which of these they want to focus on. Editors get auto-invited to review the changes. Timely means within a week.

All changes to the handbook are made via pull requests. A content pull request can only be included when:

* Two editors approved the change[^2]
* All pending conversations are marked resolved

[^2]: Note that any changes after having received a review, will require new reviews. This is especially relevant if the changes have been approved already.

## How to keep an overview of everything?

With so many issues and pull requests, it is easy to get lost. We have a project management board that can be helpful identifying what is going on at this time:

* [Topics](https://github.com/orgs/ubvu/projects/7/views/1)
* [Guides](https://github.com/orgs/ubvu/projects/7/views/2)

## Etiquette

As editors, we may have to make tough calls at times. It is important for us to make people feel welcome and appreciated, even if their contribution is not immediately included. That being said, we reciprocate the consideration given to us.

### Deleting branches

After merging Pull Requests, it is expected to clean up the branch by deleting it. We enable auto deletion upon merging, but if that for some reason does not happen, please go ahead and "Delete branch"

### Closing pull requests

Not all pull requests make it into the handbook, and that is okay. We want to ensure that pull requests are not closed at random, and provide some norms around doing so.

Stale pull requests can be closed with a note for the contributor that they are welcome to request the pull request to be re-opened. We automatically mark pull requests as stale after 30 days.

Pull requests that provide too much discussion and do not have a pathway to resolution may be closed for being disputed. This does not mean the content goes to waste â€“ here we recommend an issue to be opened to continue the discussion. Please note that disputed topics can only be carried on if done so in a mutually constructive manner.
